        <h5>Sue Schwar, Founder</h5>
        <p>Sue has always had a passion for animals, her earliest memory being that of rescuing worms from the school playground after it had rained. Her involvement in caring for wildlife began in 1992 after taking in an orphaned fox cub found whilst on a night shift when Sue worked at the local police station. Establishing a purpose built wildlife hospital soon became her ambition which was finally achieved when the hospital was opened in 2009.</p>
        <p>Sue works 24-7 for the charity which she often finds exhausting but her commitment to animal welfare wins over her need for a decent night's sleep. Sue has inspired many other people to care about wildlife and is also a trustee for the British Wildlife Rehabilitation Council.</p>

        <h5>Tom Linsel, MVDR, MRCVS</h5>
        <p>Tom came to the UK in 2007 to seek his fortune from his native Slovakia where he qualified as a vet. While working as a locum Tom brought wildlife to the hospital, Sue spotted his potential resulting in Tom moving in with her in 2014. Tom's compassion for wildlife is evident in his dedication towards his patients. Tom is often called upon to deal with the out of hours emergencies so it's not unusual for him to be up all night!</p>
